# ComparativeStudyOfCountries
Comparative study of countries using TABLEAU
The company is expanding and wants to open new branches in various parts of the world.My task is to compare various parameters such as income, life insurance share etc..
Created a dashboard in Tableau to compare all the parameters for different countries, to strategize market penetration and to target new customers.
Created a geographic map showing the countries' fields. Color the map based on the income column from the secondary dataset.
Used KPI tables  to show the comparison between the selected period and the period prior to the selected one.
Used a trend line to show the selected category values.
